	<nav><p>To learn more about gardening, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardening">head this way.</a>
	<p><a href="http://chiotsrun.com/">Chiots Run</a> is a website I found about gardening. It's a family run garden, named after their dog. The site is pretty informative, including pictures of all sorts of things that they're growing. However, the navigation is a little troublesome. There's not an easy way to get to any particular section, so the main page is very long. It ends up looking a little sloppy. Otherwise, it's a cool place to check out what these people are doing.
